WARNING:Par:62 - Your design did not meet timing.  The following are some suggestions to assist you to meet timing in
   your design.

      Review the timing report using Timing Analyzer (In ISE select "Post-Place &
      Route Static Timing Report").  Go to the failing constraint(s) and select
      the "Timing Improvement Wizard" link for suggestions to correct each problem.

   Try the Design Goal and Strategies for Timing Performance (In ISE select Project -> Design Goals & Strategies) to
   ensure the best options are set in the tools for timing closure.

   Increase the PAR Effort Level setting to "high"

   Use the Xilinx "SmartXplorer" script to try special combinations of
   options known to produce very good results.

Asterisk (*) preceding a constraint indicates it was not met.
   This may be due to a setup or hold violation.

WARNING:Par:62 - Your design did not meet timing.  The following are some suggestions to assist you to meet timing in
   your design.

      Review the timing report using Timing Analyzer (In ISE select "Post-Place &
      Route Static Timing Report").  Go to the failing constraint(s) and select
      the "Timing Improvement Wizard" link for suggestions to correct each problem.

   Try the Design Goal and Strategies for Timing Performance (In ISE select Project -> Design Goals & Strategies) to
   ensure the best options are set in the tools for timing closure.

   Increase the PAR Effort Level setting to "high"

   Use the Xilinx "SmartXplorer" script to try special combinations of
   options known to produce very good results.

Asterisk (*) preceding a constraint indicates it was not met.
   This may be due to a setup or hold violation.

WARNING:Par:62 - Your design did not meet timing.  The following are some suggestions to assist you to meet timing in
   your design.

      Review the timing report using Timing Analyzer (In ISE select "Post-Place &
      Route Static Timing Report").  Go to the failing constraint(s) and select
      the "Timing Improvement Wizard" link for suggestions to correct each problem.

   Try the Design Goal and Strategies for Timing Performance (In ISE select Project -> Design Goals & Strategies) to
   ensure the best options are set in the tools for timing closure.

   Increase the PAR Effort Level setting to "high"

   Use the Xilinx "SmartXplorer" script to try special combinations of
   options known to produce very good results.

Asterisk (*) preceding a constraint indicates it was not met.
   This may be due to a setup or hold violation.

WARNING:Par:62 - Your design did not meet timing.  The following are some suggestions to assist you to meet timing in
   your design.

      Review the timing report using Timing Analyzer (In ISE select "Post-Place &
      Route Static Timing Report").  Go to the failing constraint(s) and select
      the "Timing Improvement Wizard" link for suggestions to correct each problem.

   Try the Design Goal and Strategies for Timing Performance (In ISE select Project -> Design Goals & Strategies) to
   ensure the best options are set in the tools for timing closure.

   Increase the PAR Effort Level setting to "high"

   Use the Xilinx "SmartXplorer" script to try special combinations of
   options known to produce very good results.

Asterisk (*) preceding a constraint indicates it was not met.
   This may be due to a setup or hold violation.

* Net Skew is the difference between the minimum and maximum routing
only delays for the net. Note this is different from Clock Skew which
is reported in TRCE timing report. Clock Skew is the difference between
the minimum and maximum path delays which includes logic delays.

Timing Score: 167

WARNING:Par:62 - Your design did not meet timing.  The following are some suggestions to assist you to meet timing in
   your design.

      Review the timing report using Timing Analyzer (In ISE select "Post-Place &
      Route Static Timing Report").  Go to the failing constraint(s) and select
      the "Timing Improvement Wizard" link for suggestions to correct each problem.

   Try the Design Goal and Strategies for Timing Performance (In ISE select Project -> Design Goals & Strategies) to
   ensure the best options are set in the tools for timing closure.

   Increase the PAR Effort Level setting to "high"

   Use the Xilinx "SmartXplorer" script to try special combinations of
   options known to produce very good results.

Asterisk (*) preceding a constraint indicates it was not met.
   This may be due to a setup or hold violation.

WARNING:Par:62 - Your design did not meet timing.  The following are some suggestions to assist you to meet timing in
   your design.

      Review the timing report using Timing Analyzer (In ISE select "Post-Place &
      Route Static Timing Report").  Go to the failing constraint(s) and select
      the "Timing Improvement Wizard" link for suggestions to correct each problem.

   Try the Design Goal and Strategies for Timing Performance (In ISE select Project -> Design Goals & Strategies) to
   ensure the best options are set in the tools for timing closure.

   Increase the PAR Effort Level setting to "high"

   Use the Xilinx "SmartXplorer" script to try special combinations of
   options known to produce very good results.

Asterisk (*) preceding a constraint indicates it was not met.
   This may be due to a setup or hold violation.

is reported in TRCE timing report. Clock Skew is the difference between
the minimum and maximum path delays which includes logic delays.

WARNING:Par:62 - Your design did not meet timing.  The following are some suggestions to assist you to meet timing in
   your design.

      Review the timing report using Timing Analyzer (In ISE select "Post-Place &
      Route Static Timing Report").  Go to the failing constraint(s) and select
      the "Timing Improvement Wizard" link for suggestions to correct each problem.

   Try the Design Goal and Strategies for Timing Performance (In ISE select Project -> Design Goals & Strategies) to
   ensure the best options are set in the tools for timing closure.

   Increase the PAR Effort Level setting to "high"

   Use the Xilinx "SmartXplorer" script to try special combinations of
   options known to produce very good results.

Asterisk (*) preceding a constraint indicates it was not met.
   This may be due to a setup or hold violation.

WARNING:Par:62 - Your design did not meet timing.  The following are some suggestions to assist you to meet timing in
   your design.

      Review the timing report using Timing Analyzer (In ISE select "Post-Place &
      Route Static Timing Report").  Go to the failing constraint(s) and select
      the "Timing Improvement Wizard" link for suggestions to correct each problem.

   Try the Design Goal and Strategies for Timing Performance (In ISE select Project -> Design Goals & Strategies) to
   ensure the best options are set in the tools for timing closure.

   Increase the PAR Effort Level setting to "high"

   Use the Xilinx "SmartXplorer" script to try special combinations of
   options known to produce very good results.

Asterisk (*) preceding a constraint indicates it was not met.
   This may be due to a setup or hold violation.
